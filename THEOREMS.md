# Theorems — the tension ledger

Each section names a tension from PLAN.md and the invariant that
resolves it. A theorem lands together with the code it constrains; a
section is listed here before its first proof so the tension is on the
record even while open.

| § | Tension | Invariant | Where |
|---|---------|-----------|-------|
| §Frame | evolvable protocol vs simple daemon | `decode (encode m) = ([m], ∅)`; unknown tag skips exactly its frame | Theorems/Wire.lean |
| §Chunk | TCP/pty chunking is arbitrary vs stateful parsers | decode/feed invariant under concatenation: `feed (a ++ b) = feed b ∘ feed a` | Theorems/Wire.lean, Theorems/Vt.lean |
| §Bound | zellij crashes under cpu/mem load (unbounded actor queues) | every buffer has a structural cap preserved by `step`; nothing to fill | Theorems/Wire.lean, Theorems/Vt.lean, Theorems/Session.lean |
| §Total | emulator fed adversarial bytes vs no crashes ever | `Vt.step`/`feed` total (no `partial`, grep-checked); `Good` invariant preserved for any byte: cursor + saved + alt-stashed cursors strictly in bounds, top ≤ bot < rows. (Dims-invariance of `step` is by-construction, not a stated theorem — see SCRATCHPAD step 4.) | Theorems/Vt.lean |
| §Detach | sessions outlive clients (the zmx decoupling) | zero-client session still advances; detach/detach-all don't touch the screen (only permitted effect: a checkpoint) | Theorems/Session.lean |
| §Restore | reboot-resume vs corrupt/stale state files | `load (save s) = some s` (parser state quiesced); `load` total on arbitrary bytes | Theorems/Checkpoint.lean |
| §Name | user-chosen names vs filesystem paths | sanitized names can't escape the socket dir (no `/`, `..`-prefix, NUL, empty) | Theorems/Name.lean |
| §Remote | trusting `ssh host lzmx list` output vs local TUI safety | parser total, garbage-tolerant; §Name carries through; display fields scrubbed of control bytes | Theorems/Remote.lean |
| §Bound(tui) | a picker over a changing list | selection stays inside the filtered matches; query capped | Theorems/Tui.lean |


## Reading a row

Each § is proved for *all* inputs, not sampled: the state machines are
`List`/`Nat`-shaped precisely so the inductions go through. Proofs use
`native_decide` nowhere; the unit tests in `Tests/` do, because they
pin concrete behavior (golden bytes, screen contents) where evaluation
is the point.

Each row was **break-verified**: the code was deliberately broken once
to watch the theorem catch it, and the break is recorded in
`SCRATCHPAD.md`. A theorem that survives a wrong definition is worth
nothing.

## What these theorems do not settle

* **§Total covers the emulator, not the runtime.** `Zmx/Runtime/*` is
  `IO` with `partial def` loops; its correctness rests on the live
  suites in `tests/`, not on proof. The pure/impure line is the
  `Zmx/Core` boundary, enforced by `tests/e2e.sh`.
* **§Bound bounds our buffers, not the OS's.** A peer that never reads
  eventually fills the kernel socket buffer; the runtime caps its own
  per-client queue at 4 MiB and disconnects rather than grow. That cap
  lives in `Zmx/Runtime/Daemon.lean` and is not proved.
* **Grid dimensions are invariant by construction, not by theorem.**
  Every operation preserves `cols`/`rows` syntactically (RIS
  re-derives them through `clampDim`), but the statement is not
  proved; the runtime re-reads dimensions after every feed.
* **§Restore says the codec round-trips, not that the shell's world
  is restored.** A resumed session gets its screen, scrollback, modes,
  labels and cwd back — not its process tree. That is the deliberate
  continuum-shape trade: the work resumes, the programs do not.
