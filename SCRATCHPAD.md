# Scratchpad — read before writing; append, never rewrite

## Step 0 notes — recon (2026-06-01)

Settled: scope = feature-complete **zmx** + session-manager TUI, not
tmux. Rationale + non-goals recorded in specs/lean-zmx.md.

Environment (measured):
- Host AL2, glibc 2.26. Lean toolchain v4.32.0's bundled clang cannot
  run here ("GLIBC_2.29 not found"); builds need
  `LEAN_CC=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/clang` (Homebrew clang 22) and
  the toolchain lib dirs on LIBRARY_PATH. Recipe proven in
  ~/lean-tmux/env/lean_env.sh; baked into ./lake wrapper here.
- elan 4.2.3; toolchains v4.31.0 + v4.32.0 installed. No default set —
  a bare `lean --version` outside a project fails; per-repo
  lean-toolchain file drives it.
- fish is the login shell; fzf present; no zmx binary installed.

Prior art mined (~/lean-tmux STATE.md — worth re-reading when stuck):
- Effects-as-data state machines (`step : State → Event → (State, List
  Effect)`) worked well there; reuse the shape, not the code.
- Their runtime-last ordering meant nothing runnable ever shipped.
  Here runtime lands at Step 6 of 10.
- Lean gotchas recorded there that apply to fresh code: `|>.` binds
  outside an `if`; C-style `u_int` wrap semantics; `decide` can't chew
  big tables (use native_decide); fuel-bounded recursion beats
  `partial def`.

Interface requirements (from ~/.tmux.conf + ~/.config/zellij/config.kdl):
Dracula palette (#282a36 bg, #44475a gray, #f8f8f2 fg, #6272a4 muted,
#ff79c6 pink=selected, #50fa7b green=active/attached, #f1fa8c yellow,
#ff5555 red=dead), status bar at top, activity traffic-light coloring,
truncated fixed-width names (=|14|…), fzf-ish list+preview layout,
minimal chrome (zellij pane_frames false, simplified UI).

zmx facts (README, verbs to mirror): attach is upsert; detach key
ctrl-\ (disable via env NO_DETACH_KEY); multiple clients per session;
socket per session in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zmx; ZMX_SESSION env inside;
labels get/set/unset/clear; list --short/--where k=v; history --vt;
wait; run -d; ssh workflow = `ssh -t host zmx attach name`.


## Step 2 notes — 2026-06-01

Settled: entire OS surface = c/shim.c (~25 wrappers) + Zmx/Posix.lean.
Conventions: all Lean object args borrowed (@&); tuples returned as
packed UInt64 (pid<<32|fd) to keep C dumb; read returns Option
ByteArray (none=EOF, some #[]=EAGAIN); write returns Int64 (-1 = peer
gone, a value not an exception, so daemons treat disconnects as data).

New env finding: toolchain's llvm-ar ALSO glibc-blocked (like its
clang); wrapper now sets LEAN_AR=/usr/bin/ar. Lake honors LEAN_AR.

Lean gotchas hit: imports must precede module doc comments; `a |>.f ≥ n`
parses as `a |>. (f ≥ n)` — parenthesize; String.trim deprecated in
4.32 (returns Slice now) — avoided.

Hand-off: daemon loops should poll-then-read (drain in ZTest.lean is
the shape); accept fd must be setNonblock'd (poll/accept race); reap
via waitpidNohang poll loop, -2 means not-our-child (use alive).


## Step 3 notes — 2026-06-01

Settled: wire codec on List UInt8 (runtime converts at the socket
edge) — this bought real ∀-theorems where lean-tmux had native_decide
fixtures. §Frame (decode∘encode = id, incl. stream form), §Chunk
(feed (a++b) = feed a then feed b), §Bound (decoder buf ≤ 4+maxPayload
for ANY input; sticky error on oversize claim; every delivered payload
≤ maxPayload) all proved, no sorry, no native_decide in Theorems/.

Break-verified: oversize branch returning `bytes` instead of `[]`
broke 5 theorems (feed_append, takeFrames_append, errored_buf,
buf_le, msgs_payload_le). Reverted.

Proof recipes that worked (reuse in later steps):
- WF-recursive defs: `rw [f.eq_def]; dsimp only` to unfold one layer;
  `induction xs using f.induct` — name the `have len` binder too, then
  `replace hlen : <real type> := hlen` to zeta-expand.
- let-pattern `let (a,b,c) := e; …`: `rcases h : e with ⟨a,b,c⟩` then
  `rw [h]` — never project h.1/h.2 (Prod eq isn't a structure).
- UInt roundtrips: `apply UInt32.toNat_inj.mp; simp [UInt8.toNat_ofNat',
  UInt32.toNat_ofNat']; omega`.
- decidable-if chains over UInt8 tags: prove per-branch with by_cases;
  in a POSITIVE branch simp [hK] alone collapses the whole chain.
- `split` cannot reach ifs under a projection like (if..).payload —
  by_cases instead.
- decide fails on WF-recursion (kernel can't reduce takeFrames);
  tests of runtime behavior use native_decide, golden encode tests
  stay decide.

Hand-off: tags frozen in Tests/Wire.lean golden frames (input=0,
output=1, resize=2, attach=3, detachAll=4, kill=5, info=6, infoReply=7,
history=8, exited=9, wait=10, labelSet=11, labelUnset=12, labelClear=13,
done=14, err=15). New tags append; never reuse.


## Step 4 notes — 2026-06-01

Settled: Vt = per-byte `step` + `feed = foldl step` (so §Chunk is
List.foldl_append, definitional); restore-grade scope (no reply
channel, no reflow-on-resize, OSC8/sixel skipped) — rationale in
Vt.lean header. Render.restore replays main+alt when in alt screen.

Proved (Theorems/Vt.lean): `Good` composite invariant — cursor + saved
+ alt-stashed cursors in bounds, top≤bot<rows, scrollback ≤ 10000, CSI
params ≤ 16, OSC acc ≤ 2048, u8need ≤ 3 — preserved by step/feed for
ANY byte stream (§Total+§Bound), plus feed_append + feed_singletons
(§Chunk) and resize/init Goodness. ~45 lemmas.

The theorems caught two real bugs while proving:
1. subFlags array could outgrow its guard (only params was checked) —
   fixed by construction: one Array (Nat × Bool).
2. resize didn't clamp the SAVED cursor — DECRC after a shrink would
   restore out of bounds. Fixed + the resize cursor-rides-down idea
   simplified to plain clamp.
Break-verified: uncapping Ring.push broke 3 theorems. Reverted.

Downgraded (recorded honestly): dims-invariance of step is NOT a
proved theorem — every op preserves cols/rows syntactically except RIS
(re-derives via clampDim, identity under Good), but stating it needs
per-op dims lemmas through ite/foldl compositions (~25 more lemmas).
The runtime re-reads cols/rows after feed, so nothing depends on it.
THEOREMS.md §Total row updated.

Proof recipes added this step:
- Restructure code for proofs: tuple-lets → named ites; big functions
  → named stages (printWrap/printPut/...; stepGround/stepCsi/...);
  computed bounds → local `min` clamps. Each turned a stuck proof
  into a 5-liner.
- Good-preservation via obtain 15 fields / rebuild ⟨tuple⟩ — record
  updates are defeq so the same tuple often just works.
- Case-order-robust dispatch: `repeat' split; all_goals first | exact
  lemA | ...` instead of positional bullets (match arms with
  multi-patterns expand unpredictably).
- `rw [if_pos hc]/[if_neg hc]` after by_cases when `split` can't see
  through a projection-of-ite; `set` is Mathlib-only (unavailable).
- NEVER `git checkout <file>` to revert an experiment on UNCOMMITTED
  work (was lucky: file was untracked). String-level revert instead.

Hand-off (step 5+): daemon feeds Vt via feedBytes; reattach sends
Render.restore v; preview via Render.previewLines; runtime must clear
v.bell after signaling activity; resize via Vt.resize (Good-preserving).


## Step 5 notes — 2026-06-01

Settled: Session = effects-as-data machine (step : State → Event →
State × List Effect); decoding lives IN the machine (per-client
Wire.Decoder), so §Bound covers it. maxClients 16, maxLabels 64,
checkpoint cadence 60s via tick. Clean child exit DROPS the
checkpoint (resume is for crashes/reboots, not completed work).

Proved: §Detach (closed/detachAll leave vt+labels untouched with zero
effects; zero-client ptyOut advances vt identically; attach preserves
scrollback; input never touches vt), §Bound(session) (clients/labels/
decoder caps preserved by step for any event), §Frame machine-half
(unknown + wrong-direction msgs → (s, [])), step_vt_good (daemon's Vt
stays Good under any event stream — composes Vt.Good with the machine).
§Name: sanitize establishes Valid for ANY input (no /, no NUL, no
leading dot, nonempty, ≤80) + no-escape corollary.

Break-verified: gating ptyOut's vt.feed on attachment (the zmx
anti-pattern) broke 3 theorems + 2 tests. Reverted.

New recipes:
- `first`-alternative lists: a bare `simp` that PARTIALLY succeeds
  eats the goal and reports unsolved at the end — always `(simp;
  done)` inside `first`.
- foldl-with-lookup preservation: name the fold (feedMsgs) in the CODE
  so theorems can target it; induction generalizing the accumulator.
- `set` tactic is Mathlib-only; `generalize h : expr = x` is the core
  replacement (after dsimp to zeta-reduce lets).
- Msg-driving tests via real Wire.encode frames double as decoder-path
  integration tests.

Hand-off (step 6 runtime): effects contract — send/close/writePty/
resizePty/killChild/checkpoint/dropCheckpoint/exit; runtime owns
per-client outbufs (cap 4 MiB, disconnect on overflow — the §Bound
half that lives outside the machine, document in AGENTS); wait replies
arrive via childExited; runtime supplies Event.tick every poll round.


## Step 6 notes — 2026-06-01

lzmx is a working program: attach(upsert)/run/send/detach/list
(--porcelain)/kill/history/wait/get/set/unset/clear/version/help.
Verified via tests/attach_test.py (pty-driven, 8 checks): detach key
ctrl-\, restore-on-reattach, two-client mirroring, background
advance, exit-status through `wait`.

Runtime shape: Daemon.pollRound (fd→Event) + pump (Effect→syscall,
follow-up events re-enter the machine so the roster stays true);
per-conn outbufs capped 4 MiB (runtime §Bound half: slow client =
disconnected, never growth). Client polls at 200ms and diffs
winsizeGet for resize (no signal machinery at all).

Bugs found live:
- pollRound iterated rt.conns AFTER accepts appended to it → revs
  index misalignment → daemon panic "index out of bounds". Fix:
  snapshot `polled` before poll; conns joined mid-round wait for the
  next round. LESSON: any poll loop must freeze its fd set.
- one-shot verbs that expect no reply (send/kill) must not drainReplies
  — added Client.sendOnly; detachAll now replies done.
- python pty.fork() gives 0x0 winsize → clamps to 1x1 grid — set
  TIOCSWINSZ in test harnesses (a real terminal always has a size).

Gotchas: Int64.toNat is toNatClampNeg in 4.32; `(a, b : T)` tuple
ascription must be ((a, b) : T); pkill -f 'lzmx' matches the CALLING
shell's own cmdline — use pkill -x lzmx.

Step-7 seam ready: Cli.Hooks {save, drop, load}; daemon calls
save/drop on checkpoint effects; connectUpsert calls load for
resume-cwd; __daemon passes restoreVt into serve.


## Step 7 notes — 2026-06-01

Settled: checkpoint = magic "LZMX"+v1, LEB128 Nats (UNCONDITIONAL
roundtrip — no fits-in-u32 caveats anywhere), full Vt minus parser
state (Vt.quiesce; a checkpoint loses at most one partial escape
sequence), ring geometry verbatim. Atomic write (tmp+rename); corrupt/
torn/foreign file → load = none → fresh start (§Restore totality is
by construction: R α = List UInt8 → Option, structural recursion).
Save points: 60s-while-dirty tick + last-attached-client detach.
Clean child exit DROPS the checkpoint; SIGKILL keeps it.

Proved: rt_* combinator ladder → load_save (exact modulo quiesce) +
load_save_exact. §Detach restated: detach's only permitted effect is
checkpoint. Fixed en route: marks-cap 8 in Vt.print (unbounded
combining-mark growth — a §Bound hole found by checkpoint design
review).

Verified live (tests/resume_test.py, 7 checks): detach-checkpoint,
SIGKILL survival, restore of screen+labels+cwd on reattach, clean-exit
drop, corrupt-checkpoint tolerance.

New recipes:
- do-notation Option chains reduce with `simp only
  [Option.bind_eq_bind, Option.bind_some]` + RT-lemmas as simp args —
  but ONLY if RT is an `abbrev` (a `def` Prop wrapper makes hypotheses
  opaque to simp).
- UInt8 literal toNat needs `show (128:UInt8).toNat = 128 from rfl` in
  simp sets (toNat_ofNat' covers ofNat-applications only).
- set_option goes BEFORE the doc comment.
- `clear` UInt-typed hypotheses before omega when they drag opaque
  atoms in.
- Test-harness lesson: `list` shows the SHELL pid; the daemon is
  `pgrep -f '__daemon <name>'` + /proc environ filter for isolation.
- My python -c inline edits fail silently on quote/escape collisions —
  ALWAYS verify with grep after, or use str_replace on files.


## Step 8 + abduco review notes — 2026-06-01

Step 8 done: pure fzf-shaped picker (Core/Tui: step + render, one
mode, Dracula/status-top per the user's configs) + terminal shell
(Runtime/Tui). Attach EXECS the plain client — TUI never sits in the
byte path. §Bound(tui) proved (sel clamped into matches, query ≤ 64).
8/8 pty-driven checks (tests/tui_test.py) incl. type-to-create and
C-x C-x confirm-kill.

PLAN.md updated by user: added abduco reference ("but unmaintained").
Reviewed abduco README; borrowed 3 cheap wins, all tested:
1. `lzmx watch <name>` — read-only attach (observer attaches 0×0,
   input dropped daemon-side too — theorem onMsg_input_readonly).
2. Newest-real-attacher owns the pty size (Session.sizeOwner);
   observers and older mirrors can't fight the active user's size.
3. `clients` count in info (abduco's `*` marker, as data for list/TUI).
Rejected: keep-corpse-for-exit-status (conflicts attach-is-upsert;
our `wait` + exited-frames cover it), SIGUSR1 socket recreation
(checkpoint+resume already covers daemon-loss better), configurable
detach key beyond the env kill-switch (PLAN: no customization).
Deliberate stale-size-on-owner-detach: §Detach purity (detach's only
effect is checkpoint) outranks perfect mirror re-fit — documented.

Step 9 (remote over ssh) next: Core/Remote parser + TUI wiring
(hostLabel/Host.remote already in place), then Step 10 verify.


## Steps 9 + 10 notes — 2026-06-01 (spec closed)

Step 9: Core/Remote parses `list --porcelain` from other machines.
Threat-model treated as hostile-by-default: §Name carries (proved) so
a remote name can't build a path, and display fields are `scrub`bed of
control bytes (proved) so a remote can't inject ANSI into our frame.
Unreachable host → [] (BatchMode + ConnectTimeout 3), never blocks the
picker. Attach = `ssh -t host lzmx attach name`, exec'd; nothing is
tunnelled. Verified with a fake `ssh` on PATH (tests/remote_test.py,
8/8) which is also how the argv is pinned.

Step 10: tests/e2e.sh is the whole-deliverable gate — clean rebuild,
warning-free, no sorry/partial/IO in the core, extern-only-in-Posix,
one C file, then all four live suites. Green. README + THEOREMS "what
these do not settle" written; spec moved to specs/archive with a
completion record and the scope-conditioned gaps.

Test-harness lesson: my sanitizer assertion was wrong, not the code —
`sanitize "../../etc/passwd"` = `_._.._etc_passwd` (only a LEADING dot
is rewritten; interior dots are legal and harmless with no `/` left).
Check what the code actually returns before "fixing" it.

State: PLAN.md delivered. Anything further (copy-mode, panes, config)
opens a NEW spec — the archived one is closed.
